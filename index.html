                    The Eiffel Tower, La Tour Eiffel in French, was the main exhibit of the Paris Exposition — or World's Fair — of 1889. It was constructed to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and to demonstrate France's industrial prowess to the world.
                    The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

                    The Burj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m and a roof height of 828 m, the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009.At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems, and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit. It is still a smazing building.

                </h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left">
                    The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor within New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

                    The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery.[8] After its dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.

                    Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

                <p>I loved the movie a lot
                    As I am a great fan of marvel
                    Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>

                <p>Had to watch this movie a second time before I wanted to put up a review. And as I thought, I enjoyed the movie a second time more than the first. We all know this, but it’s a very artistic film, and such a fresh take on the iconic clown prince of crime that we all know and love. This movie is probably the most realistic comic book film I have seen to this day, which was an instant plus point in my eyes. First off, hats off to Joaquin Phoenix to portraying this complex character very well, it’s great to see how much of depth he took the character to, and not to forget, he nails the iconic Joker laugh so well, which plays a major role to the character. It’s not easy deciding if he or Heath Ledger was a better Joker, because both versions are entirely different with completely different back stories. And that brings me to my next point, the direction that Todd Phillips took this character to, in terms of character origin, even though it may not be comic accurate, it was executed very well. It first appeared to be a big risk that was being taken but it turned out to be a success, it is great to see something entirely different, while managing to maintain the basic foundation of Joker’s character. The cinematography is another reason that makes this film worth watching, watching this movie a second time amazed me to see the countless number of unique and artistic shots that this film consists of, whether you are a DC fan, or a comic book fan in general, or even part of the audience who has never even heard of Joker, you will enjoy the film because of it’s unique cinematography alone, believe it or not, I actually took screenshots of many shots from the film for absolutely no reason, but was a lot of fun. The score is another strong element to the film, the score adds a depth of intensity to every scene of the film and sends chills down your spine, and that is what we need to expect from a movie based on one of the most dangerous villains ever. The plot is very captivating, powerful , mature and thought provoking, that leave audiences in the edge of their seat. One thing that amazes me to this day is how the movie added a touch of the real world and proves such a man can indeed be created by society. I do not love drama movies to such an extent, but definitely do not dislike them, and indeed this film, in my opinion is a MASTERPIECE. Give this movie a watch. Worth your time and I hope this review is helpful.</p>

                    The president said the federal agency overseeing the handover must "do what needs to be done", even as he vowed to keep contesting his election defeat.

                    The General Services Administration (GSA) said it was acknowledging Mr Biden as the "apparent winner".

                    It came as Mr Biden's victory in the state of Michigan was officially certified, a major blow to Mr Trump.

                    The GSA announcement means the president-elect now has access to top security briefings, office space and government officials as he prepares to take office on 20 January.

                    Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma are unlikely to board a flight to Australia in the next three-four days, The Indian Express understands. Also, it is learnt that the Indian team management hasn’t yet received any communication from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) or BCCI as regards to when the two are joining the squad. And if that’s the case, then going by Indian team head coach Ravi Shastri’s comment, both might miss the entire Test series.

                    Rohit (hamstring injury) and Ishant (ribcage injury) are currently at the NCA for their rehab and on Sunday, Shastri expressed apprehension on the two players’ participation in the upcoming Test series unless they fly out in the next “three to four days”.

                    It's more than 40 years since the Americans and the Soviets brought home lunar rock and "soil" for analysis.

                    China aims to be only the third country to achieve this feat, which will be an extremely complex endeavour.

                    It's a multi-step process that involves an orbiter, a lander-ascender and finally a return component that uses a capsule to survive a fast and hot entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission.

                    But confidence should be high after a series of well-executed lunar missions that started just over a decade ago with a couple satellites.

                            In the year 2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual world where most of humanity spends their days.

                            When the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself.

                            Then Wade cracks the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take this prize. The race is on—and the only way to survive is to win.

                        <p class="p_modal">The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three volumes that comprise The Lord of the Rings novel. Set in a mythical universe of Middle-earth, this book continues in the same tone as The Hobbit. The Dark Lord, Sauron, is the Lord of the Rings, who is on a mission to reclaim the One Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth.

                            The Fellowship Of The Ring commences with a birthday party in Hobbiton. Bilbo Baggins, the current possessor of the Ring, turns 111 and bequeaths the ring to his cousin, Frodo Baggins. Several years pass and the wizard Gandalf routinely visits Frodo in Bag End. One spring night, he tells Frodo the truth about the Ring and the story behind it. He informs him that Sauron has risen again and is in search of the Ring. Upon learning this, Frodo departs from the Shire alongside three Hobbit friends: Sam, Merry and Pippin.

                            Along the way, the four of them are faced with several obstacles and distractions, including Ringwraiths, who are the servants of Sauron, a malevolent willow tree and an evil tomb ghost. The group befriends wandering Elves on the way and set upon their path across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, intending to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lords plan.
